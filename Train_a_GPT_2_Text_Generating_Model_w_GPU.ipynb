            "I am applying to this role, firstly as someone who enjoys working in an entrepreneurial fashion, and secondly as a technologist. I have been working with Credit Suisse as technology analyst since I graduated as a Computer Engineer from the College of Engineering Pune. My most enjoyable professional experiences have been two greenfield projects I have contributed to. The first was a big-data project for our firm-wide Global Markets AI/ML Sandbox that I developed almost single handedly. The second is my current project, which one of four pilot projects to prepare CFO Technology for the adoption of public cloud.\n",
            "\n",
            "The reason why I appreciate these projects is the opportunity to start from scratch with no architecture, unfamiliar technologies, direct business understanding  and being able to spin up an MVP in a few months, and then scale it enterprise-wide. I have been working almost exclusively in the Agile methodology since graduation. In fact, I organised Credit Suisse’s partnership for the Pune Agile UnConference in 2019 and have been part of multiple forums and trainings since. \n",

            "I have proven myself within Credit Suisse to be able to deliver strong proof-of-concept projects. However, being an established international bank, there isn’t a continuous flow of such projects. And hence I am seeking an opportunity to work in digital consulting with a leading firm like BCG where I believe this is the modus-operandi.\n",
